                    I like to play videogames (obviously), I used to ride my bike all the time and for half of
                    my freshman year and my entire sopmore year I worked out. I also watch anime and I used
                    to have an app on my phone the let me animate frame by frame and I'd always take up like 500 frames. 
                    I used premade characters that I could just move the joints or whole figure then I'd set the playback speed to 60
                    frames per second and it'd be a short little animation. I think the app was called "stick node" or
                    something like that. I played football my sophmore year but I was awful. 
                    I also watch anime and making fun of my friends (they do the same to me).

                    Out of all of my family members I am closest to <em><strong>Elijah Sanchez</strong></em> who is in the other IT Academy
                    class and my little sister <em><strong>Charleigh</strong></em>. I didn't like the school in florida (I was in 1st grade) because another
                    student in my class was playing games on his computer and I told him that he needed to work on something or
                    I'd tell the teacher, He said that if I told on him that he'd chop my fingers off with his safety scissors.
