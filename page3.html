                        I've known devon since 7th grade and we've been friends since then, we were the only 2 trombones players in band and Alex was also
                        in band at the time but I didn't really know him all that well. Joeseph I met back in 2nd Grade, I don't really remember how. 
                        I met everyone else once I got into highschool. My freshman year Joseph and I sat with the rest at lunch and we all became pretty close friends.
