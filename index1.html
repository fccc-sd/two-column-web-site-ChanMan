                    </h1>
                    There are 89 playable characters to unlock. You start out with 8 fighters. 
                    You can either play the story mode / main game, or you can play duels 
                    whether it be versus a friend or an ai, either one will unlock more characters
                    each with diofferent move sets. In the main game you are dropped in an unfamiliar 
                    area and have to fight your way to saving your friends and yourself. In the duels, 
                    there are customizable rules based on either lives (stocks) or time.

                    <h1>Who's The Best Main?</h1>
                    <p>
                        For those who are unaware, a main is the character that you like using the most.
                        You MAINly use them. Kirby is the best character in Smash Bros.
                        If you don't already know, Kirby is the little pink guy that you get when you 
                        first start the game. Most people that play smash make the mistake of not using 
                        kirby because he's one of the first 8 unlocked fighters. However, his abilities 
                        put him easily high up on the list of best mains. He's a light character so he 
                        moves quick, he has 5 midair jumps, he has an ability to turn into something 
                        heavy which hurts anything below him when he smashes into them and he can 
                        untransform quickly. He also has a sword slash that can attack anemies 
                        from above and below. He is a small character with a small hitbox, his 
                        height is supposed to be 8 inches from other games but in smash bros 
                        he's bigger so he doesn't let him has too much of an advantage.

                    <h1> 
                        Gamemodes
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        There are two main gamemodes. There's A duel type gamemode and a Storyline to play. 
                        In the duels, you can set the location, song, duration, amount of lives, and even 
                        special items. You can choose your character or just pick the "random" option to 
                        get a random character. Therer are multiple options for enemies, whether you want 
                        it to be a cpu or another person. CPUs have levels from 1-9, 1 being the easiest, 
                        9 being the hardest. If you want to play another person youu can either play them 
                        online or in person if you have another controller. If you want to play the storyline,
                        you are dropped off in an unfamiliar landscape and hacve to rescue yourself and your 
                        friends by fighting all of the enemies to make a path away. This is a great way to 
                        unlock new characters, however it's a lot of fighting for little reward. However if 
                        you show you are good in a duel, the game will have random characters show up to
                        fight at the end of the duel. If you fail the figth, they can be faught again in
                        the main menu. There's also 2 gamemodes that aren't that big. There's training
                        where you can train against enemies and test out new combos and items. There's
                        also a mode where you see how far you can launch a punching bad based on how much
                        damage you can give it within a given time.
